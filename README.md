# Interval Pattern Sampling from Numerical Data

This repository provides everything necessary to evaluate **FIPS** and **HFIPS**, two approaches for sampling interval patterns from numerical data, proportionally to, respectively, frequency and the product of hyper-volume and frequency.

## Content of the repository:
1. **Source Code for FIPS:** Implementation of the FIPS sampling method (see src directory).
2. **Source Code for HFIPS:** Implementation of the HIPS sampling method (see src directory).
3. **Source Code for uniform Sampling (With Coverage):** A method for sampling interval patterns uniformly, ensuring non-empty coverage (see src directory).
4. **Source Code for uniform Sampling (Without Coverage):** A method for uniform interval pattern sampling that does not guarantee coverage (see src directory).
5. **Source code for lunching experiments:** All the experimental evaluation is implemented in the evaluation class. To execute a specific evaluation method, you just have to uncomment it in the main class (see main and evaluation classes in src directory)
6. **Benchmark Datasets:** The datasets used in the experimental protocol (see benchmark directory).
8. **Graphical Results:** Visual representations of the experimental results for each dataset (see the result directory).
